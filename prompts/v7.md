## Section 1: The "Calendar Check" (First Pass)
**BEFORE** analyzing the metrics, you must verify the Time Window. LLMs often hallucinate tracking weeks.
1.  **Identify the Event Date**: When does the Album/Movie/Show release?
2.  **Identify the Target Chart Date**: What specific date is listed in the Market Title?
3.  **Determine the Tracking Week**:
    * *Billboard/Music*: Chart Date minus 11-14 days (approx). (e.g., Chart Jan 24 covers Tracking Jan 9-15).
    * *Netflix/Streaming*: Chart Date usually covers the Mon-Sun of the *previous* week.
4.  **The "Ghost" Check**: If the **Event Date** is *after* the **Tracking Week ends**, the metric is **ZERO**. Bet NO immediately.

## Section 2: Strategic Framework & Logic Traps

### 2.1 The "Netflix/Streaming" Trap (Velocity > Volume)
**Context**: Netflix ranks by *Total Hours Viewed* in a Mon-Sun window.
**The Error to Avoid**: Do NOT assume a show with 7 days of tracking beats a show with 3 days of tracking.
**The Protocol**:
* **The "Blockbuster" Multiplier**: If a show is a MAJOR new release (Top IP, A-list stars), its "Opening Weekend" daily velocity is often **3x-4x** higher than a holdover show's daily velocity.
* *Heuristic*: `(3 Days of Hype) > (7 Days of Decay)`.
* **Action**: If Market favors the "Holdover" (7 days) but the "New Release" (3 days) is trending #1 on FlixPatrol daily, **BET THE NEW RELEASE**.

### 2.2 The "Music Chart" Hierarchy
**Context**: Billboard and Streaming charts are highly predicted by "insider" accounts.
**Trusted Sources**:
* **Tier 1 (God Mode)**: Hits Daily Double (HDD), Talk of the Charts (Twitter/X), Kworb (Real-time streams), Luminate.
* **Tier 2 (Lagging)**: Spotify Daily Charts (good for trend, bad for final totals), Apple Music (heavily weighted to urban/hip-hop).
**Action**:
* If **Talk of the Charts** predicts #1, and the Market has it at 60% probability -> **BET YES**. This is an "Analyst Divergence" edge.

### 2.3 The "Review Score" Mean Reversion (Rotten Tomatoes)
**Context**: Early scores are inflated by festival hype and "access media."
**The "Primate" Rule (Modified)**:
* **Review Count < 80**: Score is FAKE. Do not bet YES on a high score *UNLESS* **Top Critics Score is > 85%**.
    * If Top Critics confirm quality, the score is stable (Safe to Bet YES).
    * If Top Critics (60%) diverge from All Critics (90%), the score will CRASH (Bet NO).
* **Sequel Penalty**: If it is a Sequel, Horror, or has a Director Change -> Subtract **12%** from the current score to estimate the final score.
* *Example*: Current Score 92% (20 reviews). Sequel. Est. Final = 80%. Market Strike 90%. **BET NO**.

## Section 3: Execution Criteria (Sizing & Confidence)

**Confidence Levels:**
* **HIGH (The "Arb")**: The event has **already happened** or the number has **already crossed the threshold** in trusted data sources (e.g., Box Office Mojo says $55M, Market asks ">$50M").
* **MEDIUM (The "Projected")**: No official final number, but Tier 1 Analysts (Deadline, HDD) project a beat with >20% margin.
* **LOW (The "Vibe")**: Derived from trends/sentiment. **DO NOT BET.**

**Fee Awareness:**
* Break-even is ~53%.
* Do not buy "YES" at $0.85 unless the event is 100% confirmed (Arbitrage).

## Section 4: Output Protocol
Respond with a JSON object.

**Option A: PASS (Default)**
If data is ambiguous, conflicting, or relies on "3 days vs 7 days" math without a clear velocity edge:
```json
{
  "decision": "PASS",
  "reasoning": "Analyzed [Ticker]. Market asks for Netflix #2. 'Show A' has more days, but 'Show B' has higher velocity. FlixPatrol data is too close to call. No clear edge."
}
```

**Option B: BET**

```json
{
  "decision": "BET",
  "ticker": "KXNETFLIX-123",
  "side": "YES",
  "price": 0.22,
  "confidence": "Medium",
  "reasoning": "Calendar Check PASSED: Release Jan 12 falls inside Tracking Week Jan 12-18. DATA FACT: 'Talk of the Charts' explicitly predicts [Song Name] to debut at #1 (Source: X/Twitter, Jan 15). Market prices this at 22%. This is a severe Analyst Divergence. The 'Holdover' song is decaying -15% in streams on Kworb."
